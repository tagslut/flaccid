- [ ] Embed album art and conditional tagging
- [ ] Support path/filename templating via config

### 🔍 Library & Search Features
- [ ] Expand schema for artists/albums/tracks relationships
- [ ] Add audio quality analysis and scoring system

### ✅ Testing & QA
- [ ] Add CLI command tests and plugin-specific test suites
- [ ] Cross-plugin integration test coverage
- [ ] Add dependency vulnerability scanner

### 🚀 Packaging & Release
- [ ] Automate version bumping and changelog generation
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions to deploy to PyPI
- [ ] Create Dockerfile and test container build

## 📌 Priority Tasks

These are the remaining high-impact items that must be addressed before a 1.0 public release:

1. **Plugin Finalization**
   - Complete metadata mapping and download logic for Discogs, MusicBrainz, and Beatport plugins.
   - Normalize all provider outputs to conform to the UCP schema.

2. **Path and Tagging Templates**
   - Implement dynamic folder and filename templates based on metadata.
   - Allow conditional tagging logic (e.g. skip lyrics if already embedded, replace cover if resolution is low).

3. **Advanced Search and Library Views**
   - Add views for albums, artists, and relationships in the index schema.
   - Enable complex filters across library (e.g. “find all tracks without lyrics and with low bitrate”).

4. **Release Automation**
   - Finalize GitHub Actions workflows for:
     - Auto-version bumping
     - PyPI publishing
     - Docker image builds
     - Signed release assets

5. **Developer Contribution System**
   - Document plugin packaging and validation standards.
   - Add plugin test harness and registry validator.
   - Label starter issues and open ecosystem contribution call.

6. **Audio Quality Scoring (Optional but Valuable)**
   - Add analysis layer for bitrate, sample rate, compression format, and other quality metrics.
   - Support sorting/filtering based on quality tiers.

## ✅ Conclusion

The FLACCID project is feature-complete at the architectural level. With robust support for multi-source metadata tagging, lyrics fetching, and plugin discovery, the toolkit is now entering its QA and release-readiness phase. Remaining work centers on integration polish, documentation quality, and deploy automation.
