# FLACCID Development Log

## July 9, 2025

- **Finalized UCP (Unified Canonical Payload) structure for track metadata:**
  - Defined a schema to unify metadata fields across multiple sources (Qobuz, Apple Music, MusicBrainz).
  - Added support for core metadata fields such as title, artist, album, genre, and release date.
  - Integrated source-specific IDs (e.g., Qobuz track ID, Apple Music catalog ID) for cross-referencing.
  - Implemented support for lyrics, including synchronization timestamps for karaoke-style displays.
  - **Metadata Fields Confirmed:**
    - Core fields: `title`, `artist`, `album`, `date`, `tracknumber`, `discnumber`, `duration`
    - Source-specific IDs: `qobuz_id`, `apple_id`, `tidal_id`, `spotify_id`, `musicbrainz_id`
    - Identifiers: `isrc`, `album_upc`, `explicit`, `genre`
    - Lyrics: `lyrics.synced`, `lyrics.unsynced`
    - Source structure: `sources.primary`, `sources.fallbacks`

- **Verified integration of Qobuz, Apple Music, and MusicBrainz APIs:**
  - Conducted end-to-end tests to ensure API responses are correctly parsed and mapped to the UCP schema.
  - Addressed edge cases such as missing metadata fields and rate-limiting errors.

- **Regenerated missing modules for Beatport and Discogs:**
  - Recreated `shared/beatport_api.py` and `shared/discogs_api.py` with updated API endpoints.
  - Added error handling for API authentication failures and invalid responses.

- **Implemented Picard-style naming logic for tag filename templates:**
  - Designed a flexible template system to allow users to customize file naming conventions.
  - Supported placeholders for metadata fields (e.g., `{artist} - {title}`) and conditional logic for optional fields.
  - **Tag Filename Template Debugging:**
    - Prioritizes `%date%`, `%originalyear%`, then `%originaldate%`, defaulting to `XXXX`
    - Applies safe replacements (`:` → `꞉`)
    - Clarified that Picard does not recognize Apple-style date tags like `Date` unless mapped explicitly.

- **Confirmed active Discogs token and AcoustID API key:**
  - Verified API keys and tokens are correctly loaded from environment variables.
  - Added fallback mechanisms to prompt users for re-authentication if tokens expire.

- **Git Tree Auditing:**
  - Ran `tree -L 3` and confirmed several `tag/` and `shared/` files were missing from disk despite being approved.
  - Requested a Copilot-compatible prompt to regenerate all missing modules, which has been delivered and tailored to FLACCID’s architecture.

## July 8, 2025

- **Fixed merge conflicts in core modules (`scan.py`, `index.py`, etc.):**
  - Resolved conflicts caused by simultaneous updates to shared utility functions.
  - Refactored overlapping logic into a new `shared/utils.py` module for better maintainability.

- **Updated CI workflow to include `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting:**
  - Modified the GitHub Actions workflow to generate and upload coverage reports.
  - Ensured coverage thresholds are enforced to maintain code quality.

- **Regenerated `poetry.lock` after resolving dependency issues:**
  - Identified and removed conflicting dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
  - Verified the updated lock file works across all supported Python versions.

- **Cleaned up markdown formatting in `LATEST_IMPROVEMENTS.md`:**
  - Standardized heading levels and bullet point styles.
  - Fixed broken links and ensured compatibility with markdown linters.

## July 7, 2025

- **Added detailed session summary to `shared/beatport_api.py`:**
  - Documented the API integration process, including authentication and data mapping.
  - Highlighted known limitations and future improvement areas.

- **Verified CI pipeline triggers after committing changes:**
  - Tested the pipeline with multiple branches to ensure consistent behavior.
  - Fixed an issue where certain test cases were skipped due to incorrect path matching.

- **Fixed type safety in `config.py` for robust config access:**
  - Replaced dynamic dictionary lookups with a strongly-typed configuration class.
  - Added unit tests to validate configuration parsing and error handling.

## July 6, 2025

- **Initial implementation of `shared/qobuz_api.py` and `tag/qobuz.py`:**
  - Created API client for Qobuz with support for track search, album details, and streaming URLs.
  - Added tagging logic to enrich local music files with Qobuz metadata.

- **Added SQLite database integration for library indexing:**
  - Designed a schema to store track metadata, file paths, and analysis results.
  - Implemented CRUD operations and optimized queries for large libraries.

- **Created modular CLI structure using Typer:**
  - Refactored the CLI to use a plugin-based architecture for better extensibility.
  - Added commands for scanning libraries, tagging files, and fetching metadata.
