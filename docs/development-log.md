# FLACCID Development Log

This document tracks the development history and key decisions made during the FLACCID CLI toolkit development.

## July 9, 2025

### UCP (Unified Canonical Payload) Structure Finalized

- **Defined a schema to unify metadata fields across multiple sources** (Qobuz, Apple Music, MusicBrainz)
- **Added support for core metadata fields** such as title, artist, album, genre, and release date
- **Integrated source-specific IDs** (e.g., Qobuz track ID, Apple Music catalog ID) for cross-referencing
- **Implemented support for lyrics**, including synchronization timestamps for karaoke-style displays

#### Metadata Fields Confirmed:
- **Core fields**: `title`, `artist`, `album`, `date`, `tracknumber`, `discnumber`, `duration`
- **Source-specific IDs**: `qobuz_id`, `apple_id`, `tidal_id`, `spotify_id`, `musicbrainz_id`
- **Identifiers**: `isrc`, `album_upc`, `explicit`, `genre`
- **Lyrics**: `lyrics.synced`, `lyrics.unsynced`
- **Source structure**: `sources.primary`, `sources.fallbacks`

### API Integration Verification

- **Verified integration of Qobuz, Apple Music, and MusicBrainz APIs**
- **Conducted end-to-end tests** to ensure API responses are correctly parsed and mapped to the UCP schema
- **Addressed edge cases** such as missing metadata fields and rate-limiting errors

### Plugin System Enhancements

- **Regenerated missing modules for Beatport and Discogs**
- **Recreated `shared/beatport_api.py` and `shared/discogs_api.py`** with updated API endpoints
- **Added error handling** for API authentication failures and invalid responses

### Picard-Style Naming Logic Implementation

- **Designed a flexible template system** to allow users to customize file naming conventions
- **Supported placeholders for metadata fields** (e.g., `{artist} - {title}`) and conditional logic for optional fields

#### Tag Filename Template Debugging:
- **Prioritizes `%date%`, `%originalyear%`, then `%originaldate%`**, defaulting to `XXXX`
- **Applies safe replacements** (`:` → `꞉`)
- **Clarified that Picard does not recognize Apple-style date tags** like `Date` unless mapped explicitly

### Configuration and Authentication

- **Confirmed active Discogs token and AcoustID API key**
- **Verified API keys and tokens** are correctly loaded from environment variables
- **Added fallback mechanisms** to prompt users for re-authentication if tokens expire

### Git Tree Auditing

- **Ran `tree -L 3`** and confirmed several `tag/` and `shared/` files were missing from disk despite being approved
- **Requested a Copilot-compatible prompt** to regenerate all missing modules, which has been delivered and tailored to FLACCID's architecture

## July 8, 2025

### Merge Conflict Resolution

- **Fixed merge conflicts in core modules** (`scan.py`, `index.py`, etc.)
- **Resolved conflicts** caused by simultaneous updates to shared utility functions
- **Refactored overlapping logic** into a new `shared/utils.py` module for better maintainability

### CI/CD Improvements

- **Updated CI workflow** to include `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting
- **Modified the GitHub Actions workflow** to generate and upload coverage reports
- **Ensured coverage thresholds** are enforced to maintain code quality

### Dependency Management

- **Regenerated `poetry.lock`** after resolving dependency issues
- **Identified and removed conflicting dependencies** in `pyproject.toml`
- **Verified the updated lock file** works across all supported Python versions

### Documentation Cleanup

- **Cleaned up markdown formatting** in `LATEST_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- **Standardized heading levels** and bullet point styles
- **Fixed broken links** and ensured compatibility with markdown linters

## July 7, 2025

### Beatport API Integration

- **Added detailed session summary** to `shared/beatport_api.py`
- **Documented the API integration process**, including authentication and data mapping
- **Highlighted known limitations** and future improvement areas

### CI Pipeline Verification

- **Verified CI pipeline triggers** after committing changes
- **Tested the pipeline** with multiple branches to ensure consistent behavior
- **Fixed an issue** where certain test cases were skipped due to incorrect path matching

### Type Safety Improvements

- **Fixed type safety in `config.py`** for robust config access
- **Replaced dynamic dictionary lookups** with a strongly-typed configuration class
- **Added unit tests** to validate configuration parsing and error handling

## July 6, 2025

### Initial Implementation

- **Initial implementation of `shared/qobuz_api.py` and `tag/qobuz.py`**
- **Created API client for Qobuz** with support for track search, album details, and streaming URLs
- **Added tagging logic** to enrich local music files with Qobuz metadata

### Database Integration

- **Added SQLite database integration** for library indexing
- **Designed a schema** to store track metadata, file paths, and analysis results
- **Implemented CRUD operations** and optimized queries for large libraries

### CLI Architecture

- **Created modular CLI structure** using Typer
- **Refactored the CLI** to use a plugin-based architecture for better extensibility
- **Added commands** for scanning libraries, tagging files, and fetching metadata

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Plugin System Design

The plugin system was designed with the following principles:
- **Abstract base classes** define consistent interfaces for all plugins
- **Service-specific implementations** handle API differences transparently
- **Metadata normalization** ensures consistent data structures across providers
- **Error handling** provides graceful fallbacks when services are unavailable

### Configuration Management

Configuration follows a layered approach:
- **Environment variables** for sensitive credentials
- **TOML files** for application settings
- **Keyring integration** for secure credential storage
- **Pydantic validation** for type safety and data validation

### Database Schema Evolution

The database schema has evolved to support:
- **Track-level metadata** with full text search capabilities
- **Album relationships** for efficient querying
- **File integrity tracking** with checksums and modification times
- **Plugin source tracking** to identify metadata origins

## Future Development Priorities

Based on the development history, the following areas require continued attention:

1. **Complete Tidal Plugin Implementation**
   - OAuth Device Code Flow
   - Metadata fetching and normalization
   - Download capabilities

2. **Enhance Metadata Cascade Logic**
   - Improve field priority handling
   - Add conflict resolution strategies
   - Support for custom merge rules

3. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Integration tests for all plugins
   - End-to-end CLI testing
   - Performance benchmarking

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - API reference documentation
   - Plugin development guide
   - Troubleshooting documentation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- **Type hints** are required for all public APIs
- **Docstrings** follow Google style conventions
- **Error handling** must be explicit and informative
- **Testing** requires minimum 85% coverage

### Plugin Development

- **Inherit from base classes** defined in `plugins/base.py`
- **Implement all required methods** with proper error handling
- **Follow naming conventions** for consistency
- **Include comprehensive tests** for all functionality

### API Integration

- **Use async/await** for all network operations
- **Implement rate limiting** to respect service limits
- **Handle authentication** securely with keyring storage
- **Provide meaningful error messages** for API failures
