# Architecture Decision Record: Adopt GPL License

## Context
The project requires a license that ensures open-source contributions while protecting the code from being used in proprietary software without sharing improvements.

## Decision
Adopt the GNU General Public License (GPL) for the project.

## Consequences
- All derived works must also be open-source and licensed under the GPL.
- Ensures contributions to the project remain open-source.
- May limit adoption by companies that prefer permissive licenses like MIT or Apache 2.0.
