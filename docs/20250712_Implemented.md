### Implemente

1. **Plugin Framework**
   - Dataclasses and abstract plugin interfaces defining track/album metadata and service behavior
   - Plugin registry includes the functional Qobuz plugin and placeholder modules for Apple, Beatport, Discogs, Lyrics and Tidal.
   - Only the `QobuzPlugin` currently handles authentication, search and downloads; other plugins are skeletal.
2. **CLI Scaffolding**
   - Typer-based command groups `get`, `tag`, `lib`, and `set` with basic subcommands (e.g. `tag fetch`, `tag apply`, `get qobuz`, `get tidal`, `lib scan`, `set auth`, `set path`).
   - CLI helpers in `cli/placeholders.py` perform metadata fetch/apply and store credentials via keyring.
   - Legacy `fla` shim for backward compatibility (`src/fla/__main__.py`).
3. **Core Functionality**
   - Simple asynchronous file downloader.
   - Metadata writer with cover-art embedding and optional lyrics fetching.
   - Library management utilities for scanning directories, indexing FLAC files, and watching for changes via watchdog.
4. **Testing and CI**
   - Test suite covering placeholders, plugins, library functions and CLI commands (e.g. `tests/unit/test_library.py` includes watch library testing).
   - GitHub Actions workflow runs pre‑commit hooks and pytest across Python 3.10‑3.12.
   - Pre‑commit configuration enabling black, flake8, isort, autoflake, mypy and pytest.
5. **Documentation & Scripts**
   - Extensive documentation in `docs/`, developer handbook, usage examples, and a Cloud Shell setup guide.
   - `setup_script.sh` bootstraps a local development environment and runs tests.
   - Cloud Build YAML for optional deployment.

------

### Missing or Incomplete Features

1. **Full Plugin Capabilities**
   - Many service-specific modules under `src/flaccid/tag/` are empty (e.g. `apple.py`, `qobuz.py`, `beatport.py`).
   - Download/authentication flows for Qobuz are simplified and may not handle real API tokens or parallel downloads. Other providers, including Tidal, are not yet implemented.
2. **Metadata Cascade & Tagging Logic**
   - Metadata merging implemented via the `cascade` helper in
     `src/flaccid/core/metadata.py`. Missing fields are filled left-to-right
     when applying tags.
   - `tag fetch` and `tag apply` now use this helper to combine provider data
     and lyrics when available.
3. **Configuration Management**
   - Current `Config` class only wraps environment variables; Dynaconf + Pydantic validation is not used.
   - Storing credentials via `set auth` works but the config path settings do not integrate with the rest of the app.
4. **Database & Library Features**
   - SQLite schema only includes a simple `tracks` table; no album table or advanced search/indexing.
   - File watcher exists but lacks robust handlers and incremental update logic.
5. **Unit and Integration Tests**
   - Several CLI tests reference legacy modules (`fla.__main__`) and serve mainly as stubs.
   - Overall coverage likely below the targeted 85%, and some features remain untested (e.g. cascading metadata, real downloads).
6. **Packaging & Release**
   - `pyproject.toml` lacks console-script entry points and is missing sections for mypy exclusions and release job configuration.
   - `LICENSE` file is empty, despite GPL references in documentation.
7. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Numerous documents (e.g. `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`) are empty or outdated.
   - README and USAGE files describe commands and capabilities that are not fully implemented in the code.

### Prioritized Next Steps

1. **Finish Core CLI Functionality**
   - Replace placeholder helpers with real metadata fetch and apply logic, linking the CLI directly to plugin operations.
   - Expand use of `cascade` across plugins and CLI commands.
2. **Complete Plugin Implementations**
   - Flesh out Qobuz, Tidal, and Apple Music plugins for full authentication and download flows.
   - Implement missing modules (Discogs, Beatport, AcoustID, MusicBrainz) or remove until ready.
3. **Configuration Overhaul**
   - Introduce Dynaconf-based settings with Pydantic validation and seamless keyring integration.
4. **Library Indexing Enhancements**
   - Expand the database schema (albums table, relationships).
   - Improve `index_changed_files` to detect modifications reliably and integrate with watch functionality.
5. **Testing Expansion**
   - Replace outdated tests with meaningful unit tests for every plugin and CLI command.
   - Add integration tests exercising a basic end-to-end tagging scenario (using mocked network responses).
6. **Packaging & Release Prep**
   - Add `[tool.poetry.scripts]` entry for the `flaccid` CLI.
   - Provide complete LICENSE text and update pyproject/README accordingly.
   - Finalize GitHub Actions release job and verify `cloudbuild.yaml` uses Poetry consistently.
7. **Documentation Cleanup**
   - Consolidate docs, remove obsolete files, and ensure the README/USAGE describe only implemented featu
