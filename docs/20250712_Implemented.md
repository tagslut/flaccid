# Implemente

1. **Plugin Framework**
   - Dataclasses and abstract plugin interfaces defining track/album metadata and service behavior
   - Plugin registry importing Apple, Beatport, Discogs, Lyrics, Qobuz and Tidal implementations
   - Individual plugins implement basic authentication, search and download methods using `aiohttp` (e.g. `QobuzPlugin`, `TidalPlugin`, `BeatportPlugin`, `DiscogsPlugin`, `AppleMusicPlugin`, `LyricsPlugin`).
2. **CLI Scaffolding**
   - Typer-based command groups `get`, `tag`, `lib`, and `set` with basic subcommands (e.g. `tag fetch`, `tag apply`, `get qobuz`, `get tidal`, `lib scan`, `set auth`, `set path`).
   - CLI helpers in `cli/placeholders.py` perform metadata fetch/apply and store credentials via keyring.
   - Legacy `fla` shim for backward compatibility (`src/fla/__main__.py`).
3. **Core Functionality**
   - Simple asynchronous file downloader.
   - Metadata writer with cover-art embedding and optional lyrics fetching.
   - Library management utilities for scanning directories, indexing FLAC files, and watching for changes via watchdog.
4. **Testing and CI**
   - Test suite covering placeholders, plugins, library functions and CLI commands (e.g. `tests/unit/test_library.py` includes watch library testing).
   - GitHub Actions workflow runs pre‑commit hooks and pytest across Python 3.10‑3.12.
   - Pre‑commit configuration enabling black, flake8, isort, autoflake, mypy and pytest.
5. **Documentation & Scripts**
   - Extensive documentation in `docs/`, developer handbook, usage examples, and a Cloud Shell setup guide.
   - `setup_script.sh` bootstraps a local development environment and runs tests.
   - Cloud Build YAML for optional deployment.

### Missing or Incomplete Features

1. **Full Plugin Capabilities**
   - Many service-specific modules under `src/flaccid/tag/` are empty (e.g. `apple.py`, `qobuz.py`, `beatport.py`).
   - Download/authentication flows for Qobuz, Tidal and other providers are simplified and may not handle real API tokens or parallel downloads.
2. **Metadata Cascade & Tagging Logic**
   - No implementation of the metadata cascade or advanced tagging engine described in Phase 2A.
   - `tag fetch`/`apply` commands rely on placeholder helpers instead of real plugin data or file writing logic.
3. **Configuration Management**
   - Current `Config` class only wraps environment variables; Dynaconf + Pydantic validation is not used.
   - Storing credentials via `set auth` works but the config path settings do not integrate with the rest of the app.
4. **Database & Library Features**
   - SQLite schema only includes a simple `tracks` table; no album table or advanced search/indexing.
   - File watcher exists but lacks robust handlers and incremental update logic.
5. **Unit and Integration Tests**
   - Several CLI tests reference legacy modules (`fla.__main__`) and serve mainly as stubs.
   - Overall coverage likely below the targeted 85%, and some features remain untested (e.g. cascading metadata, real downloads).
6. **Packaging & Release**
   - `pyproject.toml` lacks console-script entry points and is missing sections for mypy exclusions and release job configuration.
   - `LICENSE` file is empty, despite GPL references in documentation.
7. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Numerous documents (e.g. `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`) are empty or outdated.
   - README and USAGE files describe commands and capabilities that are not fully implemented in the code.

------

### Prioritized Next Steps

**High Urgency:**

1.  **Finish Core CLI Functionality**
    -   Replace placeholder helpers with real metadata fetch and apply logic, linking the CLI directly to plugin operations.
    -   Implement `cascade` metadata merging and integrate with tagging commands.
2.  **Complete Plugin Implementations**
    -   Flesh out Qobuz, Tidal, and Apple Music plugins for full authentication and download flows.
    -   Implement missing modules (Discogs, Beatport, AcoustID, MusicBrainz) or remove until ready.
3.  **Library Indexing Enhancements**
    -   Expand the database schema (albums table, relationships).
    -   Improve `index_changed_files` to detect modifications reliably and integrate with watch functionality.

**Medium Urgency:**

4.  **Testing Expansion**
    -   Replace outdated tests with meaningful unit tests for every plugin and CLI command.
    -   Add integration tests exercising a basic end-to-end tagging scenario (using mocked network responses).
5.  **Packaging & Release Prep**
    -   Add `[tool.poetry.scripts]` entry for the `flaccid` CLI.
    -   Provide complete LICENSE text and update pyproject/README accordingly.
    -   Finalize GitHub Actions release job and verify `cloudbuild.yaml` uses Poetry consistently.

**Low Urgency:**

6.  **Configuration Overhaul**
    -   Introduce Dynaconf-based settings with Pydantic validation and seamless keyring integration.
7.  **Documentation Cleanup**
    -   Consolidate docs, remove obsolete files, and ensure the README/USAGE describe only implemented features.

# Implementation Updates

### Configuration Tests
   - Added tests for parsing boolean and integer values from environment variables using the `Config` class.
   - Verified default values are returned when keys are missing.

### Basic Configuration Functionality
   - Ensured the `Config` class retrieves values correctly from environment variables.
   - Tested fallback to default values when keys are absent.

### FLAC File Validation
   - Implemented tests to validate `.flac` files and reject files with incorrect extensions.
   - Used `tmp_path` fixture to create temporary files for testing.

### Metadata Utility Functions
   - Added tests for normalizing artist names and extracting metadata from FLAC files.
   - Verified ISRC extraction and metadata query building.

These updates ensure comprehensive coverage of configuration management and metadata utility functions.
