### Priority Tasks

Based on the current project status, these tasks should be prioritized:

1. **Documentation Completion** - Finalize all documentation files and ensure consistency
2. **Testing Expansion** - Increase test coverage and implement integration tests
3. **Metadata Cascade Enhancement** - Improve the metadata merging capabilities
4. **Search Capabilities** - Enhance library search functionality
5. **Release Automation** - Prepare for public release with automated workflows

### Conclusion

The FLACCID CLI Toolkit has made significant progress with all core features now implemented. The project has a solid foundation with working plugins for Qobuz, Apple Music, Tidal, and lyrics providers. The focus should now shift to enhancing the user experience, expanding test coverage, improving documentation, and preparing for a public release.

The development log shows consistent progress from the initial implementation in early July 2025 through the recent documentation centralization efforts. With the core functionality in place, the remaining tasks are primarily focused on refinement, quality assurance, and user experience improvements rather than implementing new major features.
