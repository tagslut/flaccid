# ✅ FLACCID Development Session Summary

**Date:** July 9, 2025
**Scope:** Metadata enrichment pipeline implementation and plugin verification

## 🧱 Metadata Fields Confirmed

You finalized the UCP (Unified Canonical Payload) structure for track metadata, including:

- **Core fields:** `title`, `artist`, `album`, `date`, `tracknumber`, `discnumber`, `duration`
- **Source-specific IDs:** `qobuz_id`, `apple_id`, `tidal_id`, `spotify_id`, `musicbrainz_id`
- **Identifiers:** `isrc`, `album_upc`, `explicit`, `genre`
- **Lyrics:** `lyrics.synced`, `lyrics.unsynced`
- **Source structure:** `sources.primary`, `sources.fallbacks`

## 🎧 Tagging Module Implementations

You approved and initiated integration of the following sources:

| Source      | API Module           | Tag Module           | Status                         |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Qobuz       | `qobuz_api.py`       | `qobuz.py`           | ✅ Complete                     |
| Apple Music | `apple_api.py`       | `apple.py`           | ✅ Complete                     |
| Spotify     | `spotify_api.py`     | `tag/spotify.py`     | 🔄 Approved for implementation |
| Beatport    | `beatport_api.py`    | `tag/beatport.py`    | ✅ Approved — missing from tree |
| Discogs     | `discogs_api.py`     | `tag/discogs.py`     | 🔄 Approved — next in queue    |
| MusicBrainz | `musicbrainz_api.py` | `tag/musicbrainz.py` | ✅ Implemented                  |
| AcoustID    | `acoustid_api.py`    | —                    | ⏳ Awaiting implementation      |

You also confirmed your **Discogs token** and **AcoustID API key** are active and stored for use.

## 🧪 Tag Filename Template Debugging

You reviewed and confirmed the Picard-style naming logic:

- Prioritizes `%date%`, `%originalyear%`, then `%originaldate%`, defaulting to `XXXX`
- Applies safe replacements (`:` → `꞉`)
- You clarified that **Picard does not recognize Apple-style date tags** like `Date` unless mapped explicitly.

## 🧩 Git Tree Auditing

You ran `tree -L 3` and confirmed several `tag/` and `shared/` files are **missing from disk** despite being approved:

- Files like `shared/beatport_api.py`, `tag/beatport.py`, etc., were never saved to your filesystem.
- You requested a **Copilot-compatible prompt** to regenerate all missing modules, which has been delivered and tailored to FLACCID’s architecture.

## 🔧 Next Actions

You requested:

- ✅ Verification of all modules implemented
- ✅ Copilot prompt to rebuild any missing files
- ⏳ Continue with `discogs` next
- ⏳ Implement `acoustid_api.py` with `fpcalc` fingerprint support
